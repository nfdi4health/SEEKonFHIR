<a name="authentication-basic"></a>The final authentication method uses [Basic access
authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
where the *username* and *password* correspond to a registered user on
the SEEK that is being accessed.

The **List** and **Read** API calls may be used without authentication. In
that case, they will only list, or allow reading of, publicly viewable
objects.
